👋 Hey there, I am @saroj14-png!
👀 I am keenly interested in various areas such as web design, production, home improvement, technology, art (specifically sketching and teaching my children how to draw), Netflix, and cooking!
💻 By profession, I am an IT engineer who is knowledgeable of programming language, but I have worked in design for the past few years
🌱 Currently, I am immersing myself in coding again, specifically focusing on JavaScript. I am already skilled in HTML5 and CSS. My ultimate aim is to become a front-end developer.
💞️ At the moment, I am not seeking collaboration opportunities as I am still in the learning process.
📫 You can contact me through my social media channels, which should be available somewhere around here!
😄 My preferred pronouns are she/her.
⚡ An interesting tidbit: I have always dreamt of working with computers, and now I live that dream!
